  "bio": <>I'm a digital media artist who is currently focusing on researching as part of 
  a creative practice PhD as well as doing some sessional teaching, both at RMIT. My work 
  often involves digital interfaces, experimental web design and collaborative a/v. I'm 
  very interested in exploring the embedded cultural and emotional impacts of how we might 
  be extended through digital processes and designs. Most of the recent work you can see here on my 
  website tries to think through that in some way, some more succesfully than others 
  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</>,

This website, along with the works contained within, have been created and are maintained on the 
unceded territory of the Wurundjeri people, the Traditional Owners of the Land upon which I reside 
and practice. I recognise their ongoing legacy of connection to land, waters and culture and pay 
respect to their Elders past and present. I extend this respect to all First Nations peoples of 
this continent, and to those across the globe upon whose land the material pathways that allow our 
digital connectivity are built.</>
